Pig Latin translator

This is a function that takes a piece of submitted text and translates it into Pig Latin. For words beginning with a vowel, 'ay' is added to the end. For words beginning with a consonant, the initial set of consonants is moved from the beginning of the word to the end, and then 'ay' is added. The result appears on the website.

Problems remaining:
-Punctuation should stay out of the middle of words
-On capitalized words, the first letter of the pig-Latinized version of the word should be capitalized.

I'm not sure why the wordBreak spec is failing. It appears to be working as designed.
